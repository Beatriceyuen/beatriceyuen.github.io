# Unemployables Portfolio Template
A template for the Unemployables who need to showcase their creative work, whatever that may be.
<br />
<br />

## Background
After joining the Unemployables community (https://unemployables.io/) and seeing the mission to help freelancers and self-employed people advance in their careers, I immediately starting thinking of things that I could work on to help bring value. 
<br />
<br />
**And that's when this portfolio template idea popped into mind.**
<br />
<br />
It's a simple HTML and CSS template I've shared with the Unemployables community to help them get a portfolio up and running quickly. The idea is that it's simple enough to change and customize for people who want to build a website to showcase their work, but may not be code-savvy enough. On top of that, I'll also show you how to host the site for free using Github Pages. Come join me.
