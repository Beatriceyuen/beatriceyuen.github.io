The mall provides a wide choice of shopping, dining and lifestyle facilities, housing over 300 renowned international brand shops, boutiques, and more than 50 restaurants.</div>
          <div class="body-text">YOHO Mall I was the fi rst project I worked on with Arup Hong Kong. In this project, LEDCO provided the supply and installation of the luminous ceiling system with LED and PVC stretch ceiling material. Collaborating with the E & M companies for the lighting control of our luminous ceiling provided an opportunity for me in technical skill to develop a foundation. Site inspiration and technical support in YOHO Mall I project was critical. Mall II was phase two of the YOHO Project. LEDCO gained Customer Trust and Confi dence to supply the luminous ceiling system and general lighting, including LED strip and downlight in YOHO Mall II. One of the most challenging parts is that some of the luminous ceilings were located over 16 meters of ceiling height. The installation schedule and lighting quality are essential to achieving the project’s goal.
