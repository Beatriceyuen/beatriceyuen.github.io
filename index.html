        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">Where there are people, there is light. This phrase impressed me and encouraged me to spend years in the lighting industry. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Product Engineering with Marketing at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. It developed my engineering research skills and scientific methods for analysing data that prepared me for a career in lighting.</div>
          <div class="body-text">I collaborated with different factories and designers on various types of projects. Every project sharpened my skills with excellent knowledge of luminaire products, their applications, and all stages of developing lighting products. Meanwhile, I learnt with extensive knowledge of lighting design. Over the past ten years of work, I have found that my passion for the lighting industry is stronger than ever. I made an ambitious decision to quit my job and studied a full-time master of science in light and lighting at University College London (UCL) with a distinction grade in 2021. The MSc developed my academic knowledge and raised my interest in lighting research.</div>
	<div class="body-text">Starting February 2023, I will pursue a PhD in Civil Engineering at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and work as a doctoral assistant for the Laboratory of Integrated Performance in Design (LIPID). My research will focus on exploring the perception of visual discomfort from glare when daylight and electric light are used in office areas. Hopefully, my academic performance and work experience so far will fulfil my desire to enrich mine in lighting. This website is a platform to share projects I have contributed to and research publishment in the future.</div>
